# Ask ChurchOS composer and AI setup

Send requires a verified assistant context, a nonblank question and no pending reply. It does not depend on an API key or AI mode. The existing reference-guidance mode works without a model provider.

Access loading now has a 15-second deadline and a retry message. Empty/malformed successful context responses also expose retry instead of remaining in a loading state. Replies have a 35-second browser deadline; a timeout restores the question and composer, while late responses cannot replace newer turns. Closing/unmounting, retrying context and starting a new conversation retain cancellation behavior. A helper under the question explains loading, pending responses and blank input. All server authentication, staff scope and request/budget guards remain authoritative.

For OpenAI synthesis, configure these variables on the **backend** deployment and restart/redeploy it:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: the server-only provider key.
- `ASK_CHURCHOS_AI_ENABLED=true`: explicit activation.
- `ASK_CHURCHOS_MODEL`: a model supported by the Responses/structured-output integration.
- `ASK_CHURCHOS_INPUT_USD_PER_MILLION` and `ASK_CHURCHOS_OUTPUT_USD_PER_MILLION`: current model rates for existing cost reservations. Blank or nonpositive values intentionally select reference guidance.

AI requests additionally require an active ChurchOS subscription and a successful shared Redis budget reservation. A key alone does not satisfy these application checks. See the backend `docs/ASK-CHURCHOS-2026-10-20.md` for quotas, estimated-cost accounting and output verification. No secret belongs in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`. Deployed environment values have not been inspected or changed; local configuration alone cannot establish live provider readiness.

Groq and Gemini advertise limited free API tiers. They require a provider adapter, separate server credentials and model-specific output verification before use here; replacing a provider would not fix a stalled context request. No provider switch, real generation or paid request was performed.

Deploy the web update for the composer fixes. No database migration or backend code change is required.

Short greetings such as `Hi` are accepted. Client and API both reject only blank/whitespace input (with the existing 1200-character upper bound), while retaining verified-context and in-flight request gates.
