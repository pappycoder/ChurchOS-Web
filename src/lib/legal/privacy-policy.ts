  introduction: [
    `ChurchOS is operated by ${LEGAL_COMPANY.name}, a company based in Nigeria ("ChurchOS", "we", "us" or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains our handling of personal information through our website, account services, church management platform, support channels and connected features. It also explains the different responsibilities of ChurchOS and the churches that use the platform.`,
    "This Policy is a notice about data processing. Reading it, visiting the website or accepting our commercial terms does not, by itself, provide consent for every use of personal information. Where consent is required, it must be obtained for the relevant purpose. Mandatory privacy rights remain available regardless of any contractual limitation.",

    "Your church generally decides why member, visitor, attendance, giving and pastoral records are collected. ChurchOS processes those records to provide the church's chosen services.",

It covers information collected directly, supplied by a church or another authorised person, generated through use of the service, or received from a connected provider.",
        "A church may operate its own website, publish a form, organise an event, collect giving or communicate through a provider connected to ChurchOS. That church must provide its own privacy information for its activities. Our Policy does not replace the church’s notices or the notices of payment processors, communications providers, video platforms and other independent services.",

        "For information a church submits or generates in its workspace, the church generally acts as controller and ChurchOS acts as processor on the church’s documented instructions. An authorised administrator’s use of the platform and agreed settings form part of those instructions. The precise legal role depends on the actual activity, not only the label used in this Policy.",
        "A church’s administrators manage access to its workspace, including branch assignments, roles, permissions, invitations, exports and public sharing. Staff, volunteers or contractors with access act under that church’s authority. ChurchOS support cannot automatically override a church’s permissions or disclose its records merely because a person asks for them.",
        "If your request concerns a church record, contact the church first where practical. You may also contact us directly. We will identify our role, verify the request as appropriate and assist or refer it to the responsible church without preventing you from exercising rights against us where we are legally responsible.",
