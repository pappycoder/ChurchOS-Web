    "The subscription agreement governing ChurchOS accounts, customer responsibilities, payment, data processing, service availability and allocation of risk.",
  introduction: [
    `These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern access to the ChurchOS hosted platform and related account, support and subscription services supplied by ${LEGAL_COMPANY.name}, Nigeria ("Company", "ChurchOS", "we", "us" or "our"). "Customer" or "you" means the church, ministry or other organisation subscribing to the service; an individual user must also comply with obligations applicable to that user.`,
    "An authorised representative accepts these Terms when expressly agreeing during registration or another acceptance process. A person acting for an organisation represents that they have authority to bind it. If you do not have that authority, do not create or purchase a workspace on its behalf. Access by invited users is subject to the customer’s valid agreement and each user’s applicable obligations.",
    "These Terms include provisions on payment, customer responsibility, suspension, customer indemnity, warranty qualifications and limits of liability. Those provisions allocate commercial risk and should be read before acceptance or payment. They do not exclude any right, duty or remedy that cannot lawfully be excluded.",
  ],
  highlights: [
    "Subscriptions currently renew manually. Review the plan, billing period, currency and exact checkout amount before authorising payment.",
    "The customer remains responsible for lawful collection and use of church records, staff access, communications and connected provider accounts.",
    "Liability limitations and the customer indemnity appear in sections 24 and 25, subject to express exceptions for non-excludable liability.",
    "Donations and church event payments are separate from ChurchOS subscription fees. ChurchOS is a software provider, not the recipient church or a bank.",

      paragraphs: [
        "‘Service’ means the ChurchOS hosted software and related functions made available under the selected plan. ‘Workspace’ means the customer’s church environment, including its branches and authorised users. ‘Customer Data’ means records, files, messages, form responses, personal information and other material submitted to or generated for the customer through the Service. ‘Authorised User’ means a person the customer validly permits to access its workspace. ‘Order’ means a checkout, accepted quotation or separately signed order identifying the service, plan, term, price or additional scope.",
        "The Order identifies commercial selections; these Terms supply the general service conditions. Our Website Terms and Conditions govern public website use and supplement the acceptable-use rules. Our Privacy Policy explains personal-information practices. It is not an unrestricted licence to process personal information or a substitute for a required controller–processor agreement.",
        "If documents conflict, mandatory law prevails. A separately signed agreement or processing addendum controls the subject it expressly addresses. An Order overrides these Terms only for its expressly stated commercial scope or identified exceptions. The data-processing provisions in section 16 control processor activities; these Terms otherwise control the Service over general Website Terms. The Privacy Policy does not reduce statutory privacy rights.",

Information supplied at registration must be accurate and kept reasonably current. You must not impersonate a church, administrator, provider, donor or another person, register using an identity you do not control, or misrepresent authority over an organisation.",
        "The Service is offered for lawful church, ministry and related organisational administration. You must determine whether your intended activity is lawful and suitable in each relevant location. Access is not permitted where prohibited by applicable sanctions, export controls or another binding restriction. We may reasonably request information needed to verify an account, resolve competing ownership claims or satisfy legal obligations.",
        "A person acting only as an employee or volunteer does not automatically become personally responsible for the customer’s subscription debt solely by being invited. That person remains responsible for their own unlawful acts, misuse of credentials and obligations expressly applicable to individual users.",

This is access to hosted functionality, not a sale of the platform, source code, infrastructure, underlying models or intellectual property.",
        "You may not resell, sublicense, lease or commercially provide shared access to unrelated organisations without our written agreement. A multi-branch plan permits the locations and organisational scope allowed by that plan; it does not permit an undisclosed hosting or resale business. Technical access to an endpoint does not expand the licence or override permissions, quotas or plan restrictions.",

HQ access permits broader organisational scope where the product allows it; it is not a substitute for individual permissions or a right to access another customer’s workspace.",
        "Use individual accounts, strong unique credentials and appropriate multi-factor authentication. Keep recovery codes and provider keys confidential, protect devices and email accounts, and notify us promptly of suspected compromise. Do not share credentials to evade staff limits, allow an unauthorised person to use a session, or test another customer’s access boundaries.",
        "Actions performed through a valid account may be treated as authorised for ordinary service administration unless we know or reasonably ought to know otherwise. This allocation does not make the customer responsible for an incident caused by our own failure to meet a non-excludable duty. We may require verification or temporarily restrict access where a credible compromise, ownership dispute or unauthorised instruction is suspected.",

Permissions and the customer’s settings can further restrict a feature. Buying a plan does not automatically grant every user access to all features included in it.",
        "Current Essentials, Community and Network offerings have different staff, location and role capabilities; custom roles are restricted to eligible higher plans. Enterprise scope must be agreed. The plan description presented at purchase and any express Order terms control the purchased scope, rather than an assumption based on another customer’s configuration or an old screenshot.",
        "If you downgrade or a subscription expires, additions, particular roles, exports or other paid functionality may be restricted. Existing records are not a guarantee of continued editing, creation or access under a lower entitlement. You must review limits and make necessary arrangements before a downgrade or expiry. We will not treat an entitlement reduction as permission to disclose customer records to another organisation.",

Standard plans may be offered monthly or annually; an annual payment purchases the stated annual period rather than twelve separately cancellable monthly instalments unless the Order says otherwise. Enterprise fees, implementation work or additional services require a separate agreement where not included in the displayed offer.",
        "Displayed conversions or starting prices are informational until confirmed by an applicable quote or checkout. The checkout may use a supported charge currency different from a display currency. Review the exact amount and currency before paying. Your bank or provider may impose conversion, processing, cross-border or other fees under its own agreement; ChurchOS does not set those third-party charges merely by displaying a converted estimate.",
        "A quote can expire. A pending checkout may preserve the amount and currency recorded when it was created, even if a later display or quote changes. Review any resumed payment before authorisation. Do not create duplicate payments because a return page is delayed; use the available verification process or contact us with the payment reference.",
        "Fees exclude taxes only where clearly stated. Applicable taxes, withholdings and any required supporting documents will be treated according to law and the Order. We do not impose a tax gross-up or hidden surcharge merely through a general clause in these Terms. We may correct an obvious pricing error before accepting a new Order, provide the corrected information and let you decline it; we will not silently substitute a higher amount after payment approval.",

      paragraphs: [
        "The payer must be authorised to use the selected payment method. Payment processing is performed by the provider identified at checkout. Access activation depends on verified payment and successful application to the relevant church subscription, not only a browser redirect, screenshot, debit alert or unverified client message.",
        "A pending, failed, disputed, reversed, duplicated or mismatched transaction may need reconciliation. We may request a reference and limited evidence needed to investigate. Never send a banking password, payment PIN, card security code or full secret payment credentials to support. A provider’s fraud screening or settlement delay is not a promise that we have received cleared payment.",
        "If payment is received but cannot be applied correctly, we will investigate and provide an appropriate correction or refund where due. We may suspend unpaid or fraudulently obtained access while a genuine payment issue is resolved, subject to mandatory rights and reasonable handling of evidence. We will not intentionally charge twice for the same verified service period.",

      paragraphs: [
        "Standard ChurchOS subscription renewals are currently manual. Selecting a plan, entering a payment method at a one-off checkout or receiving a reminder does not itself authorise recurring platform subscription debits. A future automatic-renewal arrangement would require appropriate disclosure and payment authorisation before it applies.",
        "The customer must renew in time to avoid interruption. Reminder delivery is not guaranteed, and a missed reminder does not by itself extend a paid period. The dates and status shown by the verified subscription record determine the applicable period, subject to correction of errors and any express Order terms.",
        "An eligible mid-period upgrade may use the prorated calculation shown in the quote and retain the existing renewal date. A downgrade may be scheduled for the next renewal and does not necessarily create an immediate refund or credit. The confirmed quote and resulting subscription record control the specific change; the interface’s displayed action must be reviewed before confirmation.",
        "Recurring giving is different from platform subscription renewal. A donor’s authorisation to a church and that church’s payment provider may permit recurring donations according to the donor’s separate mandate, even while the church’s ChurchOS software subscription renews manually.",

      paragraphs: [
        "You may stop renewing the standard subscription. To request earlier account closure, assistance with cancellation or a refund review, contact our designated email and identify the church and relevant payment. Do not assume there is a self-service cancellation, refund or complete database-deletion button where the product does not provide one.",
        "Except where the Order or mandatory law provides otherwise, a voluntary decision to stop using an otherwise properly supplied paid service does not automatically entitle you to a refund for the unused portion. This qualification does not exclude remedies for defective or misdescribed services, duplicate or unauthorised charges, a failure to deliver an agreed service, or any statutory cancellation or refund right.",
        "We will assess genuine billing complaints and provide the remedy required by the circumstances and law, which may include correction, re-performance, a reasonable partial refund or another appropriate outcome. If we permanently discontinue a prepaid service for our convenience and do not provide a reasonably equivalent agreed alternative, we will refund the unused prepaid portion attributable to the discontinued service, subject to any more favourable mandatory right.",
        "Raise a suspected billing error promptly with the reference, date, amount, currency and reason for dispute. A request for prompt notice is not a contractual waiver of a statutory claim period. A chargeback is not a substitute for an unsupported allegation, and you must not knowingly initiate a fraudulent dispute; equally, these Terms do not prohibit a genuine payment dispute or a lawful remedy through your bank, provider, regulator or court.",
        "Provider reversal and settlement times vary. We cannot promise an exact bank posting date or recover fees retained by an independent provider unless our agreement or law requires it. Approved refunds will ordinarily follow the original payment route or another verified lawful arrangement.",

      paragraphs: [
        "We may change prices, plan packaging or functionality for future Orders or renewal periods. We will make material commercial changes clear before you authorise the affected payment. A general right to update the product is not permission to charge a higher amount during an already paid fixed term without an agreed basis.",
        "We may make maintenance, security, legal and product improvements during a term. If a change materially removes an expressly purchased core function during an unexpired paid period, we will consider an appropriate alternative or remedy rather than relying only on a broad variation clause. Roadmaps, illustrative previews, beta screens and informal discussions are not binding delivery commitments unless expressly included in the Order.",

Obtain necessary notices, consents, licences and authority before uploading personal information, photographs, sermons, copyrighted material, financial details or confidential records. Maintain appropriate procedures for member corrections, data-subject requests, safeguarding and staff changes.",
        "Check dates, currencies, branch assignments, donor or member selections, account names, recipient destinations, import mappings and generated reports before relying on them. A receipt records information associated with the relevant transaction; it is not automatically a bank confirmation, a tax-deductibility certificate, an independent audit or proof that a provider has settled funds.",

Review exports, retain necessary independent copies and arrange continuity for critical church operations. These responsibilities do not relieve us of our own agreed service duties or legal obligations.",

Unless a separate written agreement expressly says otherwise, we are not the receiving church, fundraiser, donation beneficiary, event organiser, bank, insurer, custodian, escrow service, payment institution or financial adviser.",

Payment providers control their own onboarding, authorisations, fraud screening, processing, chargebacks, settlement and provider fees. An integration or generated receipt is not an endorsement of a church’s activities or a guarantee of settlement or refund.",

We can assist with platform records where authorised or legally required. This allocation does not excuse a platform error or unlawful act for which we are responsible.",

Provider charges, recipient restrictions, sender approvals, message-template rules and service availability are separate from the ChurchOS subscription unless an Order expressly includes them.",
        "You authorise processing and transmission reasonably necessary for the integrations you enable and remain responsible for the legality of those instructions. Keep provider accounts funded where required and credentials current. Platform account emails may use our organisation’s providers even when a church’s own broadcast integration is disabled.",

External services can filter, delay, reject, change or discontinue functionality. We will handle our own integration duties with reasonable care but do not control an independent provider’s entire service.",

This licence does not transfer ownership of member information or permit an unrelated advertising use of identifiable church records.",

Required legal disclosure is permitted to the necessary extent, with notice where lawful and practical.",

        "16.1 Scope. Processing concerns operation, hosting, security, maintenance, support, communications, reporting and other enabled functions of the church management service. It can involve collection, organisation, storage, retrieval, use, transmission, correction, restriction and deletion. Data subjects can include staff, volunteers, members, visitors, family members, children, donors, event participants and form respondents. Data categories include those described in the Privacy Policy, with sensitive religious or other information where lawfully supplied.",
        "16.2 Instructions. The customer determines its purposes, lawful bases and authorised settings. We will process processor-held personal information on documented lawful instructions, including the agreed Service and authorised configuration, unless law requires otherwise. We may question, suspend or refuse an instruction we reasonably consider unlawful or unsafe and inform the customer where legally permitted. Additional work outside normal functionality requires agreement on scope and reasonable charges; statutory assistance duties remain unaffected.",
        "16.3 Confidentiality and safeguards. We will restrict authorised processing access appropriately, require relevant confidentiality obligations and maintain technical and organisational safeguards appropriate to the processing risks. The customer must apply its own access, device, consent and operational controls. No clause promises absolute security, end-to-end encryption of every record, a particular certification or a guaranteed recovery point that has not been expressly agreed.",
        "16.4 Other processors. We may use providers needed for the Service, including the categories identified in the Privacy Policy. We will use appropriate written obligations for processing on our behalf and remain responsible to the extent required by law for our engagement of those processors. We will provide information and notification concerning new processors as legally required and address a reasonable, specific privacy objection in good faith. If an essential provider cannot reasonably be replaced and the objection cannot be resolved, the parties will discuss the affected service and appropriate termination or unused-fee treatment rather than presume unlimited access to the provider’s systems.",
        "16.5 Requests and incidents. Taking account of the processing and information available to us, we will provide assistance reasonably required by applicable law for rights requests, security incidents, impact assessments and regulatory enquiries. We will notify the customer of a qualifying breach of processor-held personal information without undue delay after awareness and provide information in phases where necessary. The customer remains responsible for its own controller assessments and notices; we will not prevent a required direct notification by the Company.",
        "16.6 Compliance information. On a reasonable request, we will provide information needed to demonstrate our applicable processor obligations, subject to confidentiality, security, other customers’ rights and the law. A proportionate independent review, documentation or agreed assessment can be used before invasive access. There is no general permission for unsupervised testing or inspection of unrelated tenant information. Regulatory powers and mandatory audit rights are not contracted away.",
        "16.7 Return and deletion. At the end of authorised processing, we will address the customer’s lawful choice of return or deletion as required by law and the applicable agreement, except for information lawfully required to be retained. Standard exports, where available, can support return; bespoke migration is not automatically included. Backup handling, necessary retention and any transition assistance must be addressed realistically for the relevant deployment. There is no automatic right to indefinite free hosting after termination.",
        "16.8 International processing. The customer acknowledges the use of geographically distributed providers, but acknowledgement alone is not a lawful transfer safeguard. Transfers must meet applicable legal requirements.

      paragraphs: [
        "24.1 Scope of the cap. The cap applies in aggregate to related claims arising from the same event or connected events and across legal theories, to the extent such limitation is lawful. It is based on ChurchOS software fees, not the total giving, ticket sales, payment-provider balance or other funds recorded or processed through a church’s activities. It does not apply to a separate liability that law prevents us from limiting.",
        "24.2 Excluded loss categories. Subject to section 24.3 and only where legally permitted, we are not liable for indirect, consequential, exemplary or punitive losses, or loss of anticipated profit, revenue, opportunity, goodwill or expected savings. A loss will not be called ‘indirect’ merely to avoid a remedy the law gives for a direct and proven service failure.",
        "24.3 Non-excludable matters. No disclaimer, cap, indemnity, suspension right or other provision excludes or restricts liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct, gross negligence, death or personal injury where the relevant liability cannot lawfully be limited, or any other liability, statutory right, privacy right, regulatory duty or remedy that cannot lawfully be excluded or capped. The applicable mandatory rule prevails to that extent.",

We are not responsible for a customer’s independent unlawful instruction, incorrect record, unauthorised recipient choice or provider act solely because the Service was involved, but remain responsible for our own actionable contribution. Each party must take reasonable steps to mitigate a known loss where the law requires it. You cannot recover the same loss twice under different descriptions.",
        "24.5 Commercial basis. These limits reflect the nature and price of a standard hosted software subscription and are intended to be conspicuous before agreement. A customer requiring a different allocation, committed service levels or enhanced controls should agree them in a separate written Order rather than assume they are included. Their inclusion is not a representation that every limitation is enforceable in every jurisdiction.",

It does not make an invited staff member personally guarantee the organisation’s indemnity merely by using an individual account.",

A delay reduces the obligation only to the extent it prejudices the defence.
